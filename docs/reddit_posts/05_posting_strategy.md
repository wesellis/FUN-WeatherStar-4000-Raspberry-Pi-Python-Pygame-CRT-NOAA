## Posting Order & Timeline

### Week 1: Main Launch

### Ongoing: Strategic Comments
- Check these subs daily for hijack opportunities:
  - r/AskReddit (90s threads)
  - r/raspberry_pi (project threads)
  - r/learnpython (project ideas)
  - r/nostalgia (Weather Channel mentions)

## Subreddit-Specific Tips

### High-Impact Subs
1. **r/raspberry_pi** (325k members) - Focus on Pi compatibility
2. **r/Python** (1.2M members) - Emphasize code quality
3. **r/retrogaming** (350k members) - CRT compatibility
4. **r/nostalgia** (2M members) - MUST include screenshot
5. **r/InternetIsBeautiful** (17M members) - Need live demo

### Medium-Impact Subs

- **r/weather** (165k) - Accuracy focus
- **r/90s** (145k) - Pure nostalgia
- **r/pygame** (45k) - Code examples

### Niche But Engaged
- **r/CRTgaming** - Composite output feature
- **r/VintageComputing** - Preservation angle
- **r/WeatherGifs** - Post a GIF of radar
- **r/DataHoarder** - Digital preservation

## What Makes Posts Succeed

### Must-Haves
✅ Screenshot/GIF in main post (if allowed)
✅ Brief, punchy title
✅ GitHub link in first paragraph
✅ Mention it's FREE and OPEN SOURCE
✅ List compatible Pi models
✅ Mention the smooth jazz

### Avoid
❌ Walls of text
❌ Too much technical detail upfront
❌ Asking for donations/stars
❌ Crossposting same day
❌ Arguing in comments

## Comment Strategy

### Quick Wins
- Sort by NEW in target subs
- Reply within 1 hour of post creation
- Keep initial reply short (2-3 lines)
- Always include GitHub link
- Return to add detail if upvoted

### Power Moves
1. Find weekly "What are you working on?" threads
2. Jump on "Pi project ideas" posts immediately
3. Search "weather channel" monthly, reply to all nostalgic comments
4. Monitor "old internet" discussions

## Response Templates

### To "Cool project!" comments:
"Thanks! The radar update was tricky but worth it. Let me know if you try it out!"

### To "Does it work on [X]?" questions:
"It should! Python 3.8+ and about 200MB RAM is all you need. The Pi Zero 2 W handles it fine."

### To "Why not just use [modern app]?":
"Sometimes the old way is the best way - no ads, no tracking, just weather and smooth jazz!"

### To technical questions:
"Great question! [Brief answer]. The code for that is in [file] if you want to see the implementation."

## Metrics to Track

- **Good**: 50+ upvotes, 10+ comments
- **Great**: 200+ upvotes, top 10 in Hot
- **Viral**: 1000+ upvotes, front page of sub
- **GitHub stars**: Expect 10-20 per 100 upvotes

## Follow-Up Posts (Month 2)

- "Update: Added [feature] to WeatherStar 4000+ based on your feedback!"
- "WeatherStar 4000+ on a real CRT TV from 1985 [image heavy]"
- "One month later: 24/7 uptime statistics from my Weather Channel Pi"
- "Tutorial: Setting up WeatherStar 4000+ as a smart mirror display"

## Emergency Damage Control

If getting downvoted:
- Delete if under -5 in 30 minutes
- Don't argue with critics
- Take feedback and return later
- Different angle for that sub

## Golden Rules

1. **Be helpful, not salesy**
2. **Engage genuinely with comments**
3. **Share the nostalgia, not just the link**
4. **One sub per day maximum**
5. **Comment 3x more than you post**

Remember: Reddit hates self-promotion but loves cool projects. Make it about the nostalgia and community, not the GitHub stars!
