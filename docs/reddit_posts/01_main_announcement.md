# Reddit Posts for WeatherStar 4000+ Launch

## r/raspberry_pi - Main Announcement Post

**Title:** I recreated the Weather Channel from the 90s for Raspberry Pi - Now with REAL radar!

**Post:**

Remember staying home from school, watching The Weather Channel's local forecast on loop? I've been working on bringing that nostalgia back!

**WeatherStar 4000+** is a Python recreation of the classic Weather Channel Local on the 8s, and I just released v2.1.0 with some major updates:

### What's New:
- **REAL NOAA weather radar** - Pulls live radar from weather.gov and zooms to your location
- **Live news feeds** from MSN and Reddit with category colors
- **Smooth scrolling text** just like the original
- **Classic muzak** and authentic sound effects
- **8-day forecast** with period-accurate icons

### Works great on:
- Raspberry Pi 3B+ (tested)
- Raspberry Pi 4 (smooth as butter)
- Pi Zero 2 W (perfect for dedicated display)
- Any Linux/Windows machine with Python

### Perfect for:
- Kitchen display showing weather while you make coffee
- Retro TV setup with composite output
- Background ambiance in your office
- Teaching kids about weather patterns

**GitHub:** https://github.com/wesellis/WeatherStar-4000-Python

The Raspberry Pi installer sets everything up automatically, including optional auto-start at boot. Just extract, run install.sh, and you're experiencing 1990s weather technology with 2025 data!

What would you use this for? I'm thinking about adding WeatherSTAR XL features next...

## r/retrogaming - Nostalgia Focus

**Title:** Not a game, but I recreated the 90s Weather Channel for retro CRT TVs!

**Post:**

Hey retro enthusiasts! While not technically a game, I figured you'd appreciate this blast from the past.

Built a full recreation of the Weather Channel's WeatherStar 4000 system that ran from 1990-1998. It outputs composite video perfectly for CRT TVs!

**Features that'll trigger nostalgia:**
- Exact same fonts and colors
- Smooth jazz/muzak playing constantly
- That distinctive "whoosh" transition sound
- "Local on the 8s" timing
- Even got the radar sweep animation right

Running on a Raspberry Pi 3B+ connected to my 1992 Sony Trinitron via composite. Looks EXACTLY like it did when I was faking sick to stay home from school.

Anyone else remember zoning out to this for hours? The radar is actually REAL and current - pulls from NOAA!

## r/weather - Weather Enthusiast Angle

**Title:** Built an open-source WeatherStar 4000 that pulls real NOAA data - seeking feedback from weather nerds!

**Post:**

Fellow weather enthusiasts!

I've developed an open-source recreation of TWC's WeatherStar 4000 system, but with modern data sources. Looking for feedback from people who actually understand weather!

**Technical details:**
- Pulls from NOAA/NWS API for forecasts
- Real-time radar from weather.gov (Base Reflectivity)
- Astronomy calculations using PyEphem for sun/moon
- Barometric pressure trends
- Humidity and dew point tracking
- Wind speed/direction with proper formatting

**Questions for the community:**
1. What other data sources should I integrate?
2. Any interest in GOES satellite imagery?
3. Should I add severe weather alerts?
4. Worth implementing the warning crawl system?

It's written in Python, fully open source: https://github.com/wesellis/WeatherStar-4000-Python

Currently testing how accurate the extended forecasts are compared to modern presentations. The nostalgic interface makes weather watching fun again!

What features from modern weather apps would you want in a retro interface?

## r/nostalgia - Pure Nostalgia

**Title:** That feeling when you stayed home sick and watched The Weather Channel all day... So I rebuilt it!

**Post:**

[Would include a screenshot of the Local Forecast screen]

Who else used to watch the Local on the 8s religiously? That smooth jazz, the blue and yellow graphics, waiting for your local forecast to come around again...

I spent the last few months recreating the entire WeatherStar 4000 experience in Python. It's got:
- The EXACT same music loops
- All the classic screens (even the UV index!)
- Real current weather for your location
- That satisfying page transition sound

Free and open source if anyone wants to relive 1993: https://github.com/wesellis/WeatherStar-4000-Python

My kids don't understand why I'm emotional about a weather display. Anyone else miss when The Weather Channel was actually about... weather?

## r/homelab - Technical/Homelab Angle

**Title:** Added a dedicated weather station to my homelab using a Pi and 90s Weather Channel software

**Post:**

Homelab project #47: Dedicated weather display using nostalgic interface!

Recreated the Weather Channel's WeatherStar 4000 in Python, running on a Pi 3B+ in my rack. It's actually super useful for quick weather checks without ads or fluff.

**Setup:**
- Raspberry Pi 3B+ (headless)
- HDMI to lab KVM
- Auto-starts on boot via systemd
- Pulls from NOAA API (no API key needed!)
- 287MB total footprint
- ~15% CPU usage, 180MB RAM

**Use cases in the lab:**
- Dashboard display on spare monitor
- Testing API integrations
- Teaching kids programming (it's all Python)
- Legitimate weather monitoring without bloat

Code: https://github.com/wesellis/WeatherStar-4000-Python

Considering adding MQTT publishing for Home Assistant integration. Thoughts?
